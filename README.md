# easy-image-compression
Easily locally compress images on your PC with Imagemin instead of using annoying and slow ones online that charge you for a service a monkey could make.

Install the packages and comment out line 12 to 17 to do webp conversions or comment out line 9 and 11 to do png compressions.

It's so easy so stop using slow online ones.

put all you images in a folder called images and add a folder inside there called webp. The code will look for any files in the images folder and put them in the webp folder when it is done with it.
